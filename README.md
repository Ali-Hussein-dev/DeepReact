# DeepReact.dev

An open-source search engine for React ecosystem.

## What is DeepReact?

DeepReact is a tiny search tool tailored for the React ecosystem. The React world evolves rapidly, and valuable content often gets buried soon after it’s shared. If creators lack a strong social media following or aren’t well-versed in SEO, their work tends to go unnoticed by most.

## Why we built it?

The aim is to deliver quality content created by seasoned pros and open-source contributors, offering comprehensive insights into the React ecosystem and resources ranging from beginner-friendly to advanced. We’re cutting out low-effort articles, SEO-driven fluff, and AI-generated filler. At a smaller scale, I’ve realized it’s doable to craft unique features, like an integrated directory, making it a breeze to explore the ecosystem seamlessly.

## How it works

While conventional search engines scan the web to uncover new sites and updated content, DeepReact takes a different approach — our content is handpicked by experts deeply familiar with the ecosystem. This allows our search algorithm to stay straightforward, as the resources are already vetted, eliminating the need to assess content quality using ranking algorithm. All we do is align the keywords with the titles.

## Mission

Make quality content for React devs easily accessible and discoverable.

## Techstack

DeepReact is powered by modern and reliable technologies:

- Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript, shadcn-ui
- Backend: Node.js, Vercel
- Database: Supabase, Upstash
